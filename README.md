# Bunnies Trivia Game

This is a multiplayer trivia game built in Python 3.8, featuring a server-client architecture.

Players can connect to the server and compete against each other in answering trivia questions about bunnies.

## Features

•	Server-client model for multiplayer support.

•	Simple command-line interface for ease of use.

## Prerequisites

•	Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

•	Basic knowledge of using the command line.

## How to Run the Applications

### Server:

      1.	Go to the server directory in your terminal or command prompt.
      
      2.	Execute Server.py to launch the trivia server.
      
      3.	Each time you run 'Server.py', a new server instance is created, allowing you to have multiple servers running simultaneously if needed.
      
### Client:

      1.	Navigate to the client directory using your terminal or command prompt.
      
      2.	Start the trivia client by running Client.py.
      
      3.	Similar to the server, running 'Client.py' results in the creation of a new client instance. You can run multiple clients concurrently by executing the  
      
          script multiple times.
